# Confession-Anonymous is a website I am building for people to make confessions around the World. It is basically going to be a writing blog where people can upload articles and confessions anonymously (if they want to.) Aim of this website is to help people improve their overall well-being. Research has shown that writing of instances helps individuals explore their feelings and emotions, which in return helps them manage it. So this website is going to provide a platform for people to write about their happy/sad/neutral moments and as a result, improve their overall well-being.
